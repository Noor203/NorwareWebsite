            <em><blockquote>"This site looks enticing, great job!"</em> - Anonymous client</blockquote></h2>
        <div><img src = "Images/website-proj.png" class = "projects"></div>
        <p>We had a client that wanted us to make them a website CV to highlight their <br>skills, experience
            and overall qualities to advertise to their <br>employers. This was created using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.</p>

            <h2>Library system for East-Centre Library<br> <em><blockquote>"Norware were wonderful to work with, very 
                good implementation of our requirements."</em> - librarian at East-Centre Library</blockquote></h2>
            <p>We were comissioned by a library to build a new system to replaced their pre-established paper-based system.<br>
               Our tasks were to analyse the current situation, make solutions to existing solutions, get the specifications<br>
               create prototypes (this project was heavily prototype-structured) and extensive testing by the staff. <br>
               This system was created using c++.</p>

            <h2>Train ticket reservation system  <br>
                <em><blockquote>"We can confirm that Norware did a great job with creating an easy-to-use, yet
                     secure interface."</em> - Hull Trains Update Log</blockquote></h2>
            <div ><img src = "Images/train-tickets-interface.png" class = "projects"></div>
            <p>Another client of ours was Hull Trains, who came to us to produce for them a web and mobile device
                application. This app would allow users <br>to book train tickets, which they could then use to confirm
                at the train with an ID and live update screen.
